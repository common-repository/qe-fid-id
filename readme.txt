3. The Enrollment acceptance terms for enrolling an admin account to FiD protection, requires a 4 digit numeric pin (you decide what it is).
4. Managing existing enrolled admins via the actions. You can see the number of admins the license allows in the top left of the table.
5. The wp-admin log in lock down trigger. Once set, all admin accounts that still use a username and password are blocked from logging in via wp-login, except the accounts that are enrolled via facial recognition. Disable the lock from the admin panel to allow regular password logins again. Your passwords are as they were.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Do I need a mobile phone or device? =
Q: Do I need a mobile phone in conjuction with this plugin to enable facial recognition?
A: No, you do not need any additional apps or even a mobile phone at all. This app works with any camera linked to the device you are using to sign into your site.

= Enroling admin users =
Q: Who can enrol with this plugin?
A: This plugin is intended for Administrator accounts or higher - only. Currently, we are supporting only admin user accounts, though we are working on expanding this in the future.

Q: Can a single face be enrolled for 2 or more admin accounts for the same website?
A: No, while it is technically possible, only the most recently enrolled account will be linked with your face.

Q: I'm trying to create a pin but it isn't letting me, what's going on?
A: Please ensure you are creating a numerical pin 4 digits long only.

= Licensed users =
Q: How many admin accounts can I secure with the license?
A: Each license secures up to a certain amount of admins. Please check your license for the supported number of admins.

Q: I need to use a different license with more users for a month, how can I do that?
A: Simply purchase an updated license and swap the license keys. Your data is still safe. When you are ready, cancel the license and subscription and use the old key when you no longer require that many administrators. Make sure you delete the additional users when you downgrade keys so you can continue to use the service.

= General Licensing and Migration =
Q: I bought a license but am not sure if it is enabled, how can I find out?
A: If you purchased your license from www.fidaccess.com, you will have an 'account' tab where you can see all your purchased licenses, including the domains that they are active on.

Q: I have a temporary website that I purchased a license for, I no longer need that website, is the license lost?
A: No, on the contrary, the license is locked only while it is active on that installation. If you disable the license via the wp-admin settings and then also the plugin, you can reuse the license on another site. You will have to enrol users on the new site though.

Q: I'm moving domain names, do I need a new license?
A: No, simply deactivate the license on the old domain. Once you have updated the domain to reach your WordPress installation, reactivate the license and re-enrol the users.

= Deleting the plugin =
Q: How do I delete my data entirely?
A: Simply Deactivate the Login Lock, Delete the enrolled users by clicking the bin icon (if there is no bin icon, the user is already unenrolled) then deactivate and delete the plugin.

= Pin number
Q: I forgot my pin number, can you remind me?
A: Unfortunately no, we cannot see any user's data. You will need to access your wp-admin and navigate to this plugin's settings and remove the user and re-enrol.

= My data stored on external servers?
Q: Why do you store my data on servers instead of on my WordPress installation, isn't your plugin safe enough to protect my data?
A: A good question. Imagine a scenario where an unauthorized person gets into your WordPress website's dashboard. Not only would they know your name, but they now know what you look like too. Because of the number of ways a person needs to secure their site, any vulnerability (weak passwords are only one way) that allows an attacker access to your site - will become catastrophic if they also get hold of the administrator's pictures or face data.

Q: How is my data stored?
A: Please look at the privacy policy above for full details. But basically, your data cannot be connected to you even if you had all our database data unencrypted. We opted for a completely anonymized system, and we operate on anonymous data. The only way to decipher or request the relevant data is by using the unique installation of the plugin that created it. Not even our staff know who is enrolled, nor do we have ways of creating tools to do so.

= Upgrades =
Q: New functionality is available, do I need a new license?
A: No, once you purchased a license subscription, you get access to any new functionality relevant to that tier for as long as you are subscribed.
Even if the price changes, as long as you have not cancelled your subscription, will continue at the price you signed up for.

= Terminating my license =
We are sorry to see you go.
Please reach out to us to see if we can work things out. We may accommodate requests for new features.

But we understand that we sometimes may not work for everyone.

Q: Where can I cancel my paid subscription?
A: If you log into your 'www.fidaccess.com' account, navigate to your account section and cancel your subscription. you will continue to benefit from the license until your subscription period is over. in normal circumstances.

= Support =
